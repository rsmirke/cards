# Cards — SPEC (v0.2)

A native GNOME flashcard app. Rust, GTK4, libadwaita, Blueprint. Two grades only: **Fail** and **Pass**. Cards are Markdown with LaTeX math. Scheduling is FSRS. Everything is local: no network access, no accounts.

App name: **Cards**. App ID: `io.github.rsmirke.Cards`. Licence: **GPL-3.0-or-later**.

- Crates: `cards-core` (`crates/core`, library) and `cards` (`crates/app`, GTK binary).
- Data directory: `~/.local/share/cards/`. Debug builds use `~/.local/share/cards-dev/` so development never touches real data. Both can be overridden with the `CARDS_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

v0: decks, cards, review with Fail/Pass, FSRS, SQLite. Done. Markdown rendering moved to v0.2 (§4.2); until then cards are shown as plain text. v0.2 builds on it.

## 1. Principles

1. **Data first.** Losing review history is the worst possible bug. Backups, export and migrations come before features.
2. **Core is UI-agnostic.** `cards-core` holds all logic and has no GTK dependency. It must stay testable with plain `cargo test`.
3. **GNOME-native.** Follow the GNOME HIG. Use libadwaita widgets as designed. No custom colors, no web views.
4. **Few options, good defaults.** A setting needs a reason to exist.
5. **Untrusted content.** Card text may later come from imports. It is never interpreted as HTML or markup without escaping, and never triggers network or file access outside the app's data directory.

```

- UI talks to `AppState` only, never to SQL.
- Markdown parsing lives in core (`content`) and produces a `Document` tree. The GTK layer only turns that tree into widgets. This keeps parsing testable and reusable for a future WASM or mobile front end.
- Errors: `cards-core` uses `thiserror`; the app uses `anyhow` at the edges and shows `AdwToast` for user-facing errors.
- Logging: `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber`, level from `RUST_LOG`. No card content in logs above `debug`.

## 3. Data model changes

Keep everything from v0 (migration 0001, ADR 0005). Ids are UUIDv7 stored as `TEXT`. Timestamps are UTC milliseconds. `cards` also has an internal `seq INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, a stable integer key for FTS5 that is never exported. `review_events` is the source of truth; `card_schedule` is a cache rebuilt from it. Triggers forbid `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on `review_events`, and a card with reviews cannot be deleted (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`), so card deletion is a soft delete. Add, via numbered migrations:

```sql
ALTER TABLE cards ADD COLUMN suspended INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

tags(id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE);
card_tags(card_id TEXT REFERENCES cards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
          tag_id  TEXT REFERENCES tags(id)  ON DELETE CASCADE,
          PRIMARY KEY(card_id, tag_id));

-- Undo without breaking the append-only log:
ALTER TABLE review_events ADD COLUMN undoes TEXT REFERENCES review_events(id);
-- An event with `undoes` set cancels the referenced event. rebuild_state skips both.

settings(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT NOT NULL);
-- desired_retention (0.80–0.97, default 0.90), max_new_per_day (default 20),
-- max_reviews_per_day (default 200)

media(hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY, mime TEXT NOT NULL, bytes INTEGER NOT NULL, created_at INTEGER NOT NULL);

-- Full-text search
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE cards_fts USING fts5(front_md, back_md, content='cards', content_rowid='seq');
```

Storage rules:
- `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`, `foreign_keys=ON`, `PRAGMA integrity_check` at startup (log and toast if it fails).
- **Backups:** before any migration, and once per day at startup, copy the DB with the SQLite online backup API to `<data dir>/backups/cards-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sqlite3`. Keep the 14 most recent.
- DB and backup files are created with mode `0600`, directories `0700`.

## 4. Features for v0.2 (in priority order)

### 4.1 Export / import
- Export everything to one JSON file (format has a `"format_version": 1` field): decks, cards, tags, settings, the full review log, and media as base64.
- Import that format into an empty or existing DB, with a summary before committing ("12 decks, 840 cards, 5,210 reviews"). Import runs in one transaction.
- Round-trip test: export → import into empty DB → export again produces an identical file.
- This slice exports the data that exists when it lands. Every later slice that adds data (media, settings, tags) extends export, import and the round-trip test in the same slice.

### 4.2 Markdown rendering
- CommonMark is parsed in `core::content` into a `Document` tree (blocks and inlines), with tests in core. The app's `render/` turns that tree into widgets.
- All text is escaped for Pango. Raw HTML is shown as text, never interpreted. Links are shown as text and never opened.
- The same renderer is used in review and, later, in the editor preview.

### 4.3 Math
- `$...$` inline and `$$...$$` display math in Markdown.
- Rendering: evaluate **RaTeX** first (pure-Rust, KaTeX-compatible, has `ratex-cairo` and a `ratex-gtk4` widget). Render inline math to a texture and insert it into the text flow; display math as a centered block. Formula color follows the theme foreground (works in dark mode).
- Fallback if RaTeX doesn't work out: show the LaTeX source in monospace. Never a web view.
- Invalid LaTeX shows the source with an error style, never crashes.
- Record the decision in `docs/adr/`.

### 4.4 Editor
- `GtkSourceView` 5 with Markdown highlighting, monospace, line wrapping.
- Live preview below or beside the editor (toggle), using the same renderer as review.
- Ctrl+Enter saves, Ctrl+Shift+Enter saves and starts a new card in the same deck.

### 4.5 Images
- Paste or drag an image into the card editor. It is copied into the media store (`<data dir>/media/<sha256>.<ext>`) and referenced as `![](media:<sha256>.<ext>)`.
- Only `media:` URLs render. Remote URLs and arbitrary file paths are shown as text, never fetched.
- Accept PNG, JPEG, WebP, SVG? → **no SVG** for now (script/external-reference risk). Max 10 MB.

### 4.6 Audio
- Same media store and the same `media:` reference as images: paste or drag an audio file into the editor, it is copied to `<data dir>/media/<sha256>.<ext>` and referenced as `![](media:<sha256>.<ext>)`. The renderer picks image or audio from the stored MIME type.
- Played with GTK's native media support (`GtkMediaFile` + `GtkMediaControls`): a play control in the card. No autoplay.
- Only local `media:` files play. Remote URLs and arbitrary file paths are shown as text, never fetched or opened. No network access.
- Accept Ogg (Vorbis, Opus), MP3, WAV, FLAC. Max 20 MB.
- Audio is exported and imported like images.

### 4.7 Settings / preferences
- `settings` table via a migration (§3): desired retention, max new cards per day, max reviews per day.
- `AdwPreferencesDialog`: desired retention, daily limits, backup folder "Open" button.
- Changing desired retention rebuilds the schedule from the review log (ADR 0006).

### 4.8 Stats
- Per deck and global: reviews per day (last 30 days, bar chart), pass rate, due forecast (next 14 days), and **expected retention** today = mean FSRS retrievability over reviewed cards.
- Drawn with `GtkDrawingArea` + Cairo, theme colors only. No chart library.
- All computations are pure functions in `core::stats`, tested.

### 4.9 Tags
- `tags` and `card_tags` tables via a migration (§3).
- Tags field in the card editor (comma-separated or `AdwEntryRow` chips).
- Tags are included in export and import.

### 4.10 Browser and search
- A "All Cards" page: search field (FTS5), filter by deck, tag, state (new / due / suspended).
- Multi-select: move to deck, add tag, suspend, delete.

### 4.11 Review
- Undo last grade (Ctrl+Z) via an `undoes` event.
- Daily limits from settings (§4.7). New cards interleaved with reviews.
- Card actions during review: Edit (E), Suspend, Delete (with confirmation).
- Session summary at the end: cards reviewed, pass rate, time spent.
- If a card's back is empty (or only whitespace), revealing shows only the Fail/Pass buttons, with no empty back area.

### 4.12 Polish
- `AdwAboutDialog`, keyboard shortcuts dialog, primary menu.
- Remember window size and the last selected deck.
- Every icon-only button has a tooltip and an accessible label. Full keyboard navigation.
- Empty states (`AdwStatusPage`) everywhere a list can be empty.
- Nested decks: **not** in v0.2.

## 5. Later (not v0.2)
- Meson build + Flatpak manifest + AppStream metainfo + app icon + `.desktop` file (needed to install it properly and to look like a GNOME core app).
- Translations (gettext), French first.
- Reversed cards (one note gives a front→back and a back→front card).
- Cloze cards.
- Anki `.apkg` import.
- FSRS parameter optimisation from the user's own review log.
- Sync.
- Obsidian-style in-place live preview in the editor (formulas rendered inside the text being edited, source shown where the cursor is). Needs a spike first, with its own ADR (next free number).

## 6. Never in this project
- More than two grades. Card links, proximal-zone suggestions, prerequisite graphs: those belong to the separate method app.
- Network access, telemetry, accounts.
