//! Statistics over the review log, as pure functions (SPEC §4.7, ADR 0032).
//!
//! Every count uses the entries that survive (ADR 0028): a review no undo
//! cancels, made after the card's last reset that no undo cancels.
//! [`counted_reviews`] is that rule for one card's log; the store's SQL
//! (`storage::stats`) applies the same rule and is tested against it.
//!
//! Core knows no time zones (ADR 0006, 0014). Days come from a
//! [`DayGrid`], the UTC timestamps at which consecutive study days begin,
//! which the app computes in local time. A day that is 23 or 25 hours long
//! is only a shorter or longer bucket, so daylight saving needs no code
//! here.
